# JArduCAM_USB
A Java wrapper to ArduCam_USB shield "SDK" library using JNA

Work On going, so far:

StreamingDemo.java :

Tested and fuctionnal with USB2 shield and AR0134 camera with 8bpp at 30fps (windows x64).

It reads a cfg file and let you get/set camera registers. Very simple raw bayer to RGB with subpixel convertion.
